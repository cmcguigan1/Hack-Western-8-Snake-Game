# Hack-Western-8-Snake-Game
This is the interactive, childhood favourite, game of Snake!
Developped in Java, by a team of 4 for the Hack Western 8 hackathon. This was my teams first experience working withs GUIs, action listeners, Java.swing* and much more.
Huge thanks to "Bro Code" and their YouTube channel for an excellent tutorial that provided us with a great reference to comapre to!
